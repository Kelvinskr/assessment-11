			<p>The result of Myers-Briggs test. My mind is 40 percent of extraverted and 60 percent of introverted. That means I am not very good at communicate with other people. My energy is 68 percent of extraverted and 32 percent of introverted. And the nature which is 55 percent of feeling and 45 precent of thinking. About tactics is 54 percent of judging and 46 percent of prospecting. My identity is 53 percent of assertive and 47 percent of turbulent.
				The result of learning styles shows I am 25% auditory, 60% visual and 15% tactile. So easily can see I am an visual learner. I would like to study by some videos and pictures that is the best way for me to learn new things. And also I think visual things are easy to be understand.
				So the third test I did was about personality. The result said I am an "Romantin" which is means I always do things emotional. And I need to let go of restraint, be optimistic, dare to try and finally get "cheerful".
				After three test, I think I am a shy, somewhat introverted person. This kind of personality is not conducive to my interpersonal interactions and teamwork in the future. But I may can also works well with some friends or the person who have good relationship to me. Work as a team, communication and cooperation are the two basic factors. It is hard for me to take the first step about making friends and get close to my teammates. I believe if this problem will be solved, there will be nothing to bother me. I will be work well in a team. So if I am the team leader when I build up an group I will choose some person who have opposite personality with me. They are optimistic and vivacious. They can make team have more energetic and motivated.
